    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a St. Patrick's Day staple at our house. Don't be fooled by the
      simple ingredients...The trick is getting them to layer just right. The
      key is to pour the stout SLOWLY. Enjoy!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>(12 fluid ounce) bottle lager beer (such as Harp®)</li>
      <li>
        1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Gently pour half the lager beer into a tall beer glass. Place a large
        tablespoon, dome side up, an inch or so above the lager beer, with the
        tip of the spoon pointed slightly downhill. Slowly pour half the stout
        beer over the tablespoon, so the stout gently pours down the side of the
        glass in a thick trickle. Allow to stand a few seconds so 2 distinct
        layers of beer form.
